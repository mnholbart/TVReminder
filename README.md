# TVReminder
TVReminder api test

Goal of the project is to familiarize myself with Android Studio and Android development. The project is an app that will allow you to add any TV show to your list of "favorite TV shows" and will have the functionality to remind you when a TV show has a new episode airing, or new season starting, as well as give you readily available information on the shows or see significant dates like season finales. Ideally this app would give someone who enjoys following several TV shows the ability to track all their air dates without having to look it up or remember it.
